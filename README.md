#Cocos2dx 

In order to run the game you must copy the cocos directory into the main directory in a folder called cocos2d/
The current version used is cocos2d-x-3.11

The files were copied with the command line tool at first, so it may be wise to create a new project using the console tool and then copying the cocos2d directory from that project over.

Did not want to fill up the repo with files that would rarely be changed.
